// Problem:01
/*
1.Which of the following(s) is /are  true about bubble sort: 
options : 
1.It is stable sort
2.It has a worst case space complexity of O(n)
3.It involves swapping of adjacent elements
4.After each iteration, the greatest element is placed at the end of the array.

Ans: 1+3+4 are corrects
*/

/*
2.What will the following array look like after one iteration of bubble sort [1,6,2,5,4,3].
1.[1,3,2,4,5,6]
2.[1,2,3,4,5,6]
3.[1,2,5,4,3,6]
4.[1,2,4,5,3,6]

Ans:option 3
*/

/*
3.In which case does bubble sort works in the most efficient way:
1.When the array is sorted in increasing order
2.When the array is sorted partially
3.When the array is sorted in decreasing order.
4.When the array is nearly sorted.

Ans: 1.When the array is sorted in increasing order
